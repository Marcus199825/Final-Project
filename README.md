# This web application I'm developing aims to streamline the management of personal book collections. Once users log in, they're presented with a clean dashboard showcasing their saved books. Initially blank, the collection grows as users add books manually or search by ISBN. Leveraging the Google Book API, the app fetches comprehensive book details such as title, author, page count, and average rating, enhancing the collection with rich metadata. Behind the scenes, a robust model handles data storage, ensuring secure and efficient management of user data and book collections. Additionally, the app allows users to delete books, offering flexibility in refining their collections over time. With this application, I aim to provide users with a seamless and user-friendly experience for organizing and maintaining their book inventories effortlessly.
